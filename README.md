<!-- ## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project. -->

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install the required packages with Node Package Manager:

```sh
npm install
```

### Running

Run the app in the development mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the website in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. And you will also see any lint errors in the console.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Run tests with:

```sh
npm test
```

**‚ö† You need to write tests when contributing ‚ö†**

## Api Setup

- `cd api`
- `touch .env`
  write the .env file based on this template
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY='longsecret key'
   DB_URI=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/twt
   POSTGRES_USER=user
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
   POSTGRES_DB=twt
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=<discord client id : int>
   DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=<discord client secret :string>
   ```
- `docker-compose up`
   This may fail the first time but try again

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Start by building the app with:

```sh
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

**Your app is now ready to be deployed!**
