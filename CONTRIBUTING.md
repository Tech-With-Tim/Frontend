## GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

[Pull requests](https://github.com/Tech-With-Tim/Frontend/pulls) (PRs) are the best way to propose changes to the codebase, so if you want to contribute, use PRs.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, **add tests**.
3. Ensure the test suite passes. Test with `yarn test`.
4. Make sure your code lints. Lint with `yarn run lint`.
5. Issue that PR!

## MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

**By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.**

## Report bugs

We use GitHub [issues](https://github.com/Tech-With-Tim/Frontend/issues) to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Tech-With-Tim/Frontend/issues/new), it's that easy!

### Write good bug reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Consistent Coding Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `yarn run lint` for style unification
